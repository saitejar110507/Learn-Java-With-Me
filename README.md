## 📌 Introduction to Programming Language
Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are used for interaction between people, while programming languages are designed to allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.

## 🚀 Java Programming Language
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

### 🛠 Main Features of Java
Java is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers "write once, run anywhere," meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

## 📜 Birth Of Java
Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It took 18 months to develop the first working version. This language was initially called "Oak," but was renamed "Java" in 1995. Between the initial implementation of Oak in 1992 and the public announcement of Java in 1995, many more people contributed to the design and evolution of the language.

## 🎯 Principles of Java
There were five primary goals in creating the Java language:
1. ✅ It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
2. 🔒 It must be robust and secure.
3. 🌍 It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
4. ⚡ It must execute with high performance.
5. 🔄 It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.

## 🌐 How Java Impacted the Internet
Java simplified web programming and introduced a new type of networked program called the *Applet*, which changed online content delivery. Java also addressed issues such as portability and security.

### 📌 Java Applet
- *Java Applets*: Java programs running in browsers, enabling interactive web features.
- *Execution*: Automatically runs in a browser when loaded from a link.
- *Purpose*: Handles client-side tasks like displaying data or simple calculations, reducing server load.
- *Dynamic Nature*: Applets function as active programs, executing on the client side after server initiation.
- *Decline*: Phased out from JDK 9, fully removed by JDK 11 due to technological shifts.

💡 Fun Fact: JavaScript was named after Java, but they are different languages.
