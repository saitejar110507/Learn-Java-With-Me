## 📌 Introduction to Programming Language
Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are used for interaction between people, while programming languages are designed to allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.

## 🚀 Java Programming Language
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

### 🛠 Main Features of Java
- Write once, run anywhere (WORA)
- Object-oriented and platform-independent
- Robust, secure, and high-performance
- Multithreaded and dynamic

## 📝 Java Syntax Reference
- Java is influenced by C and C++ but simplifies complexities like memory management.
- Everything in Java is inside a class.
- Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes.
- Three comment styles:
  - `//` Single-line
  - `/* ... */` Multi-line
  - `/** ... */` Javadoc (for documentation)

## 🌐 How Java Impacted the Internet
Java introduced interactive web elements through *Applets*, improving content delivery and security.

### 📌 Java Applet
- Java programs embedded in web pages.
- Provided interactive client-side functionality.
- Phased out due to security concerns and modern web technologies.

## ⚙ Getting Started with Java
### 🖥 Installing JDK
1. Download from [Oracle’s official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Verify installation: `java -version`.

### 🚀 First Java Program
```java
/* Example.java */
class Example {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("This is a simple Java program.");
    }
}
```
#### Running the program:
```sh
javac Example.java
java Example
```
Output:
```
This is a simple Java program.
```

## 🔧 Observing the Code
- **Class Name**: Must match the filename (`Example.java`).
- **main() Method**: Entry point for Java applications.
- **System.out.println()**: Prints output to the console.
- **Semicolons (;)**: Required at the end of statements.
- **Identifiers**: Java is case-sensitive (`MyClass` ≠ `myclass`).
